In our world today, there are more smart devices than there are people. A growing number of people are connected to the Internet, in one way or another, 24 hours a day.
The world is quickly being covered with networks that allow digital devices to interconnect and transmit. As society embraces these digital devices, as digital networks continue to grow around the world, and as the economic benefits of digitization continue to grow, we are seeing a digital transformation (which is the application of digital technology to provide the stage for business and industry to innovate).

Digital technology has enabled business to innovate their approach to interacting with society.
Many companies now provide some or all of their services on-line.
Sensors are everywhere generating massive amounts of data; all these sensors and measuring devices collect and transmit their data which can be stored and analyzed at a later date or it can be analyzed immediately to be used to modify computers, mobile devices, or processes of any sort.
THe stored and analyzed data is used in businesses to determine buying patterns, forecast new trends, and streamline production; in governments to monitor the environment, forecast population trends, predict crime rates, and plan for social services; in cities to control traffic, monitor parking, provide police or fire support quicker, and control waste management.

Networks form the foundation of the digitized world, they come in all sizes, they can range from simple networks consisting of two computers to networks connecting millions of devices.
Simple networks in homes enable connectivity to the Internet; they also enable sharing of resources, such as printer, documents, pictures, and music, between a few local computers.
In businesses and large organizations, networks can provide products and services to customers through their connection to the Internet.
Networks can also be used on an even broader scale to provide consolidation, storage, and access to information on network servers.
The Internet (the network of networks) is the largest network in existence and effectively provides the 'electronic skin' that surrounds the planet. Internet is a collection of interconnected private and public networks. Businesses, small office networks, and home networks connect to the Internet.

NETWORK TYPES:
	- Personal Area Network (PAN): small networks where connected wireless devices are within personal reach. Connecting your smartphone to your car using Bluetooth is an example of PAN
	- Local Area Network (LAN): typically a network in a small or local geographic area, such as a home, small business or department within a large corporation. LAN can connect two or more devices including computers, printers, and wireless devices. It provides access to larger wide area networks (WAN) and the Internet.
	- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
	- Wide Area Networks (WAN): a collection of LANs that provides inter-LAN and Internet connectivity for businesses and governments.
	- Internet: a multi-layer global network system that connects hundreds of millions of computers. This large system is comprised of multiple local and global networks serving private, public, business, academic, and government purposes.
	- Wireless Networks: computer networks that use electromagnetic waves instead of wires in order to carry signals over the various parts of the network. They can be described as PANs, LANs or WANs, depending on their scope.
	- The Cloud: a collection of data centers or groups of connected servers that are used to store and analyze data, provide access to on-line applications and corporate use.
	- The Edge: the physical edge of a corporate network.
	- Fog Computing: with the rising of sensors used by the IoT, there is often a need to store the sensor data securely and closer to where the data can be analyzed, then the analyzed data can be used quickly and effectively to update or modify processes within the organization. This allows local data to be preprocessed at the edge of the network.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of millions of smart devices and sensors connected to the Internet. These connected devices and sensors collect and share data for use and evaluation by many organizations.

Many organizations are benefiting from the data collected, saved and analyzed from sensors:
	- Businesses have more information about products that they sell and who is purchasing them.
	- Retailers are able to do more marketing, reduce losses based on unsold products, and can provide loyalty bonuses for preferred or frequent customers, as well as manage types of in-store products.
	- Manufacturers reduce downtime by predicting maintenance requirements and improving scheduling of field service employees.
	- Governments monitor environment issues, target funding for social issues, and have informed control of power output.
	- Cities have the ability to control traffic patterns based on time of day or major events, monitor and control garbage and recycling, monitor health and housing needs, and evaluate future transportation requirements.
	- Individuals can reap improved fitness and health benefits, better home and family security, and reduce costs for energy and heating systems.

HOW IoT DEVICES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK
	A sensor needs to be connected to a network (either wireless or wired Ethernet connection) so that the gathered data can be stored and shared.
	Connected to a controller that is responsible for collecting data from sensors and providing network or Internet connectivity, as well as make immediate decisions, send data to a more powerful computer in the same LANs or through Internet connection for analysis.
	Sensors often work together with actuators that take electrical input and transform the input into physical action.
	Low-powered connection options must be used to optimize and extend the availability of the sensor.

The future of networking will revolve around artificial intelligence (AI) and intent-based networking (IBN). If programmed appropriately, smart devices are able to evaluate data that is provided to them and modify processes or settings. If they are provided with sufficient data, they can 'learn' and modify their own code based on the new parameters.


FLOWCHARTS: are diagrams that are used to represent processes or workflows. They illustrate how a process should work. They should show input states, any decisions made, and the results of those decisions. A flowchart should be easy to understand without having to be an expert in the chosen field. A flowchart is a common way to represent an algorithm (a set of self-contained step-by-step instructions).

There are two common types of computer software:
	- Application software programs are created to accomplish a certain task or collection of tasks.
	- System software works between the computer hardware and the application program. It controls the computer hardware and allows the application programs to function.
Both system software and application software are created using a computer programming language which is a formal language designed to create programs that communicate instructions to computer hardware.
A compiled programming language turns the computer program into machine language before execution. An interpreted programming language interprets instructions directly without first compiling them into machine language.
C++ is an example of a compiled programming language while Python is an example of an interpreted programming language.

Programming variables can be classified into two categories:
	- Local Variables: these are variables that are within the scope of a program / function / procedure.
	- Global Variables: these are variables that are in the scope for the time the program's execution. They can be retrieved by any part of the program.

Basic program structures are:
	- IF..THEN : allows the computer to make a decision based on the result of an expression. When an IF..THEN structure is encountered, it evaluates the provided expression. If the expression is false, the computer moves on to the next structure, ignoring the contents of the IF..THEN block. If the expression is true, the computer executes the associated action before moving on to the next instruction in the program.
	- FOR Loops : used to execute a specific set of instructions a specific number of times, based on an expression. A variable acts as a counter inside a range of values identified by a minimum and a maximum. Every time the loop is executed, the counter variable is incremented. When the counter is equal to the defined maximum value, the loop is abandoned and the execution moves on to the next instruction.
	- WHILE Loops : used to execute a specific set of instruction while an expression is true. Often the instructions inside the loop will eventually make the expression evaluate as false.

PROTOTYPING
	is the process of creating a rudimentary working model of a product or system. Used for performance evaluation and further improvement of product. May be relatively expensive to produce. It is an actual, working version of the product.
	In the IoT, it is often used as a technology demonstrator.

Characteristics that indicate an organization may be dealing with Big Data:
	- They have a large number of data that increasingly requires more storage space (volume).
	- They have an amount of data that is growing exponentially fast (velocity).
	- They have data that is generated in different formats (variety).

Major data storage problems:
	- Management (data can be generated and collected from multiple different sources so a management system must be used to organize and collate all the sources. there are few data sharing standards and thousands of data management tools available)
	- Security (data must be kept secure and only accessible by authorized users)
	- Redundancy (safeguards should be in place to maintain the integrity of the stored data; processes for backups, redundancy, and disaster recovery are required)
	- Analytics (big data contains both structured and unstructured data; unstructured data such as emails or photos are difficult to analyze and consume a lot of storage space; structured data such as a spreadsheet is easier to analyze and store; data storage systems must be able to manage both types)
	- Access (big data must be accessible from anywhere at anytime)

Fog Computing
	is an architecture that utilizes end-user clients or 'edge' devices to do a substantial amount of the preprocessing and storage required by an organization.
	was designed to keep the data closer to the source for preprocessing.
	After the data has been preprocessed, it is often shipped off for longer term storage, backup, or deeper analysis within the cloud.

The Cloud and Cloud Computing
	The cloud is a collection of data centers or groups of connected servers. Access to software, storage, and services available on the servers is obtained through the Internet via a browser interface.

	From an individual's perspective, using cloud services allows:
		- to store all of data, such as pictures, music, movies, and emails, freeing up local hard drive space.
		- to access many applications instead of downloading them onto local device.
		- to access data and applications anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

	One of the disadvantages of using the cloud is that data could fall into the wrong hands. The data is at the mercy of the security robustness of the chosen cloud provider.

	From the perspective of an enterprise, cloud services and computing support a variety of data management issues:
		- it enables access to organizational data anywhere and at any time.
		- it streamlines the IT operations of an organization by subscribing only the needed services.
		- it eliminates or reduces the need for onsite IT equipment, maintenance, and management.
		- it reduces the cost of equipment, energy, physical plant requirements, and personnel training needs.
		- it enables rapid responses to increasing data volume requirements.

Distributed Data Processing takes the large volume of data and breaks it into smaller pieces. These smaller data volumes are distributed in many locations to be processed by many computers with smaller processors.

The Hadoop Distributed File System, HDFS, is a distributed, fault tolerant file system, and MapReduce, which is a distributed way to process data.
	Hadoop is open-source software enabling the distributed processing  of large data sets that can be terabytes in size and that are stored in clusters of computers.

	Hadoop has two main features that have made it the industry standard for handling Big Data:
		- Scalability (larger cluster size improve performance and provide higher data processing capabilities; with Hadoop, cluster size can easily scale from a five node cluster to a one thousand node cluster without excessively increasing the administrative burden)
		- Fault Tolerance (Hadoop automatically replicates data across clusters to ensure data will not be lost; if a disk, node, or a whole rack fails, the data is safe)

Data analytics allows business to better understand the impact of their products and services, adjust their methods and goals, and provide their customers with better products faster. The ability to gain new insights from their data brings value to the business.
Value comes from two primary types of process data: transactional and analytical.
Transactional information is captured and processed as events happen. It is used to analyze daily sales reports and production schedules to determine how much inventory to carry.
Analytical information supports managerial analysis tasks like determining whether the organization should build a new manufacturing plant or hire additional sales personnel.

The source of data in the large datasets is varied. Apart from sensor data, other data originates from anything that has been scanned, entered, and released to the Internet from sources such as:
	- Social media sites
	- HTTP, Web pages, and search engines on the Internet
	- Historical data from public and private archives
	- Metadata that is attached to emails, transmitted documents, and pictures
	- Medical forms, insurance forms, and tax forms
	- Genomics research using DNA

Data mining is the process of turning raw data into meaningful information by discovering patterns and relationships in large data sets.

Data Visualization
	To be of value, the mined data must be analyzed and presented to managers and decision makers. There are many different visualizations that can be used to present the value in the data.
	Determining the best chart to use will vary based on:
		- the number of variables to show
		- the number of data points in each variable
		- whether the data is representing a timeline
		- items that require comparisons
	Some of the most popular chart types are line, column, bar, pie, and scatter.

Chart Types
	- Line charts are most commonly used as comparison chats. They are used when there is a continuous set of data, when the number of data points is high, and to show a trend in the data over time.
	- Column charts are positioned vertically, probably the most common chart type used to display the value of a specific data point and compare that value across similar categories.
	- Pie charts are used to show the comparison of a static number; segments represent a percentage of that number; the number of categories should be kept to a minimum (not more than ten, else the slices lose meaning and impact); the total number of segments must equal 100%.
	- Scanner plots are very popular for correlation visualizations, or to show the distribution of a large number of data points.
	- Bar charts are similar to column charts except they are positioned horizontally or vertically; longer bars indicate larger numbers; they are best used when the names for each data point is long.

Analyzing Big Data for Effective Use in Business
	Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to uncover useful information. Before beginning any analysis, it is critical to know what problem the business is trying to solve or what information the business is looking for. Having a strategy helps a business determine the type of analysis required and the best tool to do the analysis; also helps to determine the most effective way to present the results for management.
	There are many Big Data Analytics tools such as Knime, OpenRefine, Orange, and RapidMiner.

AUTOMATION
	is any process that is self-driven and reduces, then eventually  eliminates, the need for human intervention.

	Applications of Automation:
		- Smart Home Automation (devices are being used to control things such as lights, locks, doors, thermostats, plugs, switches, alarm systems, window coverings, sprinkler system sensors, and more; even kitchen appliances and pet care functions are being automated)
		- Smart Buildings (deploy many of the same technologies as smart homes; can also connect to and communicate with the smart grid, enabling more efficient management of energy systems)
		- Industrial IoT and Smart Factories (industrial IoT is a network of manufacturing devices and sensors connected by secure, high speed communications technologies; this results in systems that can monitor processes; collect, exchange, and analyze data; and use that information to continually adjust the manufacturing process)
		- Smart Cities (some of these cities use technology to reduce carbon emissions or monitor CO2 levels; others use technology to provide free city wide wifi access, improve safety, or improve transportation options)
		- Smart Grids (are developing networks of transmission lines, equipment, controls and new technologies working together to respond immediately to the demand for electricity)
		- Smart Car Technology (most today's new motor vehicles have integrated safety technologies that assist drivers to be safer on the road; these technologies use a combination of hardware and software to identify safety risks and to take action to avoid a crash; their continuing evolution has given rise to Automated Driving Systems)
		- Stores and Services (tasks that were done by people are now increasingly being done by machines; systems have been designed to monitor inventory levels and automatically place orders to accurately match supply to demand and eliminate excess inventory)
		- Medical Diagnosis and Surgery (systems are developed that use technology to accurately and automatically conduct medical tests; machines are being used to more precisely control the treatment which minimizes peripheral damage to the patient)
		- Aircraft Auto Pilot (complex collection of systems automates a plane's operations; it makes adjustments to keep the plane safely on the intended path; redundancy in system design ensures that a failure in any one system would not jeopardize passenger safety)
		
	Many devices now incorporate smart technology to alter their behavior under certain circumstances.
	Whenever a decision or course of action is taken by a device on an outside piece of information, then that device is referred to as a smart device. many devices that we interact with now have the word smart in their names. this indicates that the device has the ability to alter its behavior depending on its environment.

Artificial Intelligence, AI, is the intelligence demonstrated by machines. AI uses intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and make decisions that maximize the probability of obtaining a specific goal or objective. AI refers to systems that mimic cognitive functions normally associated with human minds such as learning and problem solving.

Machine Learning, ML, is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn from their environment. this enables computers to improve on a particular task without being specifically programmed for that task. example of such tasks in computer science include malicious code detection, network intruder detection, optical character recognition, computer speech recognition, and computer vision.

Some of the more common uses of ML in IoT include:
	- Speech Recognition (many different companies now offer digital assistants which allow you to use speech to communicate with a computer system; Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon all offer this service)
	- Product Recommendation (systems build up a customer profile and recommend products or services based on previous patterns)
	- Shape Recognition (programs exist that allow crude hand-drawn diagrams and notes to be converted to more formal diagrams and text; this allows shapes and lines of hand writing to be converted to more formal text which can then be searched and analyzed)
	- Credit Card Fraud Detection (a profile is constructed about the purchasing patterns of a client; any deviation from these patterns triggers an alert and the system automatically takes action)
	- Facial Recognition (security cameras are everywhere, from stores and streets to airports and transportation hubs; these cameras continually scan the crowds, normally watching for dangerous or illegal activities, but they can also be used to identify and track individuals; the system builds a pattern of specific facial features and then watches for a match to these facial patterns triggering some action)

The Intent-Based Networking, IBN, transforms a hardware-centric, manual network into a controller-led network that captures business intent and translates it into policies that can be automated and applied consistently across the network. the goal is for the network to continuously monitor and adjust network performance to help assure desired business outcomes.
IBN is a systematic approach to tie infrastructure management to business intent.
	
	Intent-based networking harnesses the power of automation, AI, and ML to control the function of a network to accomplish a specific purpose, or intent.
	The intent-based network uses AI and ML to ensure that any services that are deployed meet the required service level. if they do not meet the service level, the intent-based network can make alerts and provide suggestions for improvement.

	The Intent-Based Networking model consists of three key elements:
		- Assurance (end-to-end verification of network-wide behavior; it predicts results of any changes, tracks compliance with the original intent, and makes recommendations or adjustments when there is a misalignment between the intent and the outcome; this stage relies heavily on AI and ML)
		- Translation (the ability to apply business intent to network configuration; the intent is specified in plain language and used by the system to create policies across the system)
		- Activation (occurs after the intent has been specified and the policies created; this is when individual devices are provisioned to match the intent-based policies)

	The Cisco Digital Network Architecture, Cisco DNA, is an example of an intent-based network. it is an open, extensible, software-driven architecture. it accelerates and simplifies enterprise network operations, while lowering costs and reducing risks.
	Cisco DNA automation and assurance are built on a software-defined networking, SDN, controller, rich contextual analytics, network virtualization, and the limitless scalability of the cloud.

Personal Identifiable Information, PII, or Sensitive Personal Information, SPI, is any data relating to a living individual that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a specific individual.

Security Best Practices:
	- Perform risk assessment (knowing the value of what is being protected will help in justifying security expenditures)
	- Create a security policy (a policy that clearly outlines company rules, job duties, and expectations)
	- Physical security measures (restrict access to network assets in networking closets and server locations; install appropriate fire suppression systems)
	- Human resource security measures (employees should be properly researched with background checks)
	- Perform and test backups (perform regular backup and test data recovery from backups)
	- Maintain security patches and updates (regularly update server, client, and network device operating system and programs)
	- Employ access controls (configure user roles and privilege levels as well as strong user authentication)
	- Regularly test incident response (employ an incident response team and test emergency response scenarios)
	- Implement a network monitoring, analytics and management tool (choose a security monitoring solution that integrates with other technologies)
	- Implement network security devices (use next generation routes, firewalls, and other security appliances)
	- Implement a comprehensive endpoint security solution (use enterprise level antimalware and antivirus software)
	- Educate users and employees (in secure procedures)
	- Encrypt data (encrypt all sensitive company data including email)

Data Center Physical Security:
	- Biometrics access and exit sensors (provides two forms of authentication)
	- Security traps (inside system to lock in an intruder, also called mantrap)
	- Security breach alarms (alarms generated in the facility control center inform data center personnel of unauthorized physical access to the facility)
	- Electronic motion detectors (provide inside security detection)
	- Continuous video surveillance (provides real time security monitoring)
	- Fences and gates (provide perimeter security to keep intruders out)
	- On premise security officers (monitor and enforce security policies)
	- Seismically braced server racks (to protect people and equipment in case there is an earthquake)
	- UPS backup generators (to protect people and equipment during a power failure)
	- Redundant HVAC controlled environment (to protect people and equipment in case the primary HVAC system goes down)
	- Gas based fire suppression systems (to protect people and equipment in case there is a fire)

	Physical security within the data center can be divided into two areas:
		- Outside perimeter security (this can include on premise security offices, fences, gates, continuous video surveillance, and security breach alarms)
		- Inside perimeter security (this can include continuous video surveillance, electronic motion detectors, security traps, and biometric access and exit sensors)

Factors that impact network security in the IoT
	- Increasing number of devices (the number of interconnected sensors and smart devices is growing exponentially, increasing the opportunity for attacks; sensors and smart devices tend to be small devices, with varying operating systems, CPU types, and memory; many of these entities are expected to be inexpensive, single function devices with rudimentary network connectivity)
	- Non traditional location of devices (some connected IoT devices are able to interact with the physical world; they are now located in appliances, in automobile, on or in human bodies, and in homes; sensors may gather data from the refrigerator or the heating system; they could also be located in city lampposts or attached to tree trunks; these non traditional locations make physical security difficult or impossible to achieve; the devices should be manufactured to be resistant to tampering, and they should be placed so that they are not obvious and are very difficult to access)
	- Lack of upgradeability (the devices are often designed to be in service many years longer than is typical for conventional high tech equipment; some IoT devices are intentionally designed without the ability to be upgraded, or they might be deployed in situations that make it difficult or impossible to reconfigure or upgrade; new vulnerabilities are uncovered all the time; if a device is non upgradeable, then they vulnerability will exist for the rest of its lifetime; if a device is upgradeable, the typical consumer may not have a technology background, the upgrade process should perform automatically or be easy enough to be performed by a layperson)

Steps to Help Protect Company Wireless Network
	- Change the default administrator password (strong passwords should contain more than 8 digits and consists of letters, numbers, and special characters)
	- Change the network service set identifier, SSID (a wireless network's name is called a service set identifier; wireless routes are usually shipped with default SSID making the network vulnerable to attack)
	- Do not advertise the SSID name (most wireless routers advertise the SSID name; employees would have knowledge of the SSID name through the company)
	- Create guest wireless network (for companies that require guest access, it is important to segregate the guest network from the employee network)
	- Enable the built in firewall (more wireless routes have built in firewalls, but sometimes they ship with the firewall turned off; make sure that the router's firewall is turned on)
	- Configure the wireless router to use WPA2-AES encryption (every router offer encryption that scrambles data and makes it unreadable to everyone except by the internet recipient; wifi protected access 2, WPA2, is best because it employs the hardest to crack encryption algorithm)
	- Keep the wireless router's firmware updated (when wireless router's firmware is kept updated, known bugs and vulnerabilities are fixed, making the router more secure)
	- Use media access control, MAC, address filtering (if only employees use a particular wireless router, configure the router to check the MAC addresses of devices trying to connect to it, allowing connections only from the devices it recognizes)
	- Disable wireless router's remote management feature (remote management feature often leaves routers susceptible to attacks; disable it if there is not the need to use the feature)
	- Physically secure the wireless router (ensure that the router is in a secure location and is only accessible by authorized personnel)
