In our world today, there are more smart devices than there are people. A growing number of people are connected to the Internet, in one way or another, 24 hours a day.
The world is quickly being covered with networks that allow digital devices to interconnect and transmit. As society embraces these digital devices, as digital networks continue to grow around the world, and as the economic benefits of digitization continue to grow, we are seeing a digital transformation (which is the application of digital technology to provide the stage for business and industry to innovate).

Digital technology has enabled business to innovate their approach to interacting with society.
Many companies now provide some or all of their services on-line.
Sensors are everywhere generating massive amounts of data; all these sensors and measuring devices collect and transmit their data which can be stored and analyzed at a later date or it can be analyzed immediately to be used to modify computers, mobile devices, or processes of any sort.
THe stored and analyzed data is used in businesses to determine buying patterns, forecast new trends, and streamline production; in governments to monitor the environment, forecast population trends, predict crime rates, and plan for social services; in cities to control traffic, monitor parking, provide police or fire support quicker, and control waste management.

Networks form the foundation of the digitized world, they come in all sizes, they can range from simple networks consisting of two computers to networks connecting millions of devices.
Simple networks in homes enable connectivity to the Internet; they also enable sharing of resources, such as printer, documents, pictures, and music, between a few local computers.
In businesses and large organizations, networks can provide products and services to customers through their connection to the Internet.
Networks can also be used on an even broader scale to provide consolidation, storage, and access to information on network servers.
The Internet (the network of networks) is the largest network in existence and effectively provides the 'electronic skin' that surrounds the planet. Internet is a collection of interconnected private and public networks. Businesses, small office networks, and home networks connect to the Internet.

NETWORK TYPES:
	- Personal Area Network (PAN): small networks where connected wireless devices are within personal reach. Connecting your smartphone to your car using Bluetooth is an example of PAN
	- Local Area Network (LAN): typically a network in a small or local geographic area, such as a home, small business or department within a large corporation. LAN can connect two or more devices including computers, printers, and wireless devices. It provides access to larger wide area networks (WAN) and the Internet.
	- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
	- Wide Area Networks (WAN): a collection of LANs that provides inter-LAN and Internet connectivity for businesses and governments.
	- Internet: a multi-layer global network system that connects hundreds of millions of computers. This large system is comprised of multiple local and global networks serving private, public, business, academic, and government purposes.
	- Wireless Networks: computer networks that use electromagnetic waves instead of wires in order to carry signals over the various parts of the network. They can be described as PANs, LANs or WANs, depending on their scope.
	- The Cloud: a collection of data centers or groups of connected servers that are used to store and analyze data, provide access to on-line applications and corporate use.
	- The Edge: the physical edge of a corporate network.
	- Fog Computing: with the rising of sensors used by the IoT, there is often a need to store the sensor data securely and closer to where the data can be analyzed, then the analyzed data can be used quickly and effectively to update or modify processes within the organization. This allows local data to be preprocessed at the edge of the network.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of millions of smart devices and sensors connected to the Internet. These connected devices and sensors collect and share data for use and evaluation by many organizations.

Many organizations are benefiting from the data collected, saved and analyzed from sensors:
	- Businesses have more information about products that they sell and who is purchasing them.
	- Retailers are able to do more marketing, reduce losses based on unsold products, and can provide loyalty bonuses for preferred or frequent customers, as well as manage types of in-store products.
	- Manufacturers reduce downtime by predicting maintenance requirements and improving scheduling of field service employees.
	- Governments monitor environment issues, target funding for social issues, and have informed control of power output.
	- Cities have the ability to control traffic patterns based on time of day or major events, monitor and control garbage and recycling, monitor health and housing needs, and evaluate future transportation requirements.
	- Individuals can reap improved fitness and health benefits, better home and family security, and reduce costs for energy and heating systems.

HOW IoT DEVICES ARE CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK
	A sensor needs to be connected to a network (either wireless or wired Ethernet connection) so that the gathered data can be stored and shared.
	Connected to a controller that is responsible for collecting data from sensors and providing network or Internet connectivity, as well as make immediate decisions, send data to a more powerful computer in the same LANs or through Internet connection for analysis.
	Sensors often work together with actuators that take electrical input and transform the input into physical action.
	Low-powered connection options must be used to optimize and extend the availability of the sensor.

The future of networking will revolve around artificial intelligence (AI) and intent-based networking (IBN). If programmed appropriately, smart devices are able to evaluate data that is provided to them and modify processes or settings. If they are provided with sufficient data, they can 'learn' and modify their own code based on the new parameters.


FLOWCHARTS: are diagrams that are used to represent processes or workflows. They illustrate how a process should work. They should show input states, any decisions made, and the results of those decisions. A flowchart should be easy to understand without having to be an expert in the chosen field. A flowchart is a common way to represent an algorithm (a set of self-contained step-by-step instructions).

There are two common types of computer software:
	- Application software programs are created to accomplish a certain task or collection of tasks.
	- System software works between the computer hardware and the application program. It controls the computer hardware and allows the application programs to function.
Both system software and application software are created using a computer programming language which is a formal language designed to create programs that communicate instructions to computer hardware.
A compiled programming language turns the computer program into machine language before execution. An interpreted programming language interprets instructions directly without first compiling them into machine language.
C++ is an example of a compiled programming language while Python is an example of an interpreted programming language.

Programming variables can be classified into two categories:
	- Local Variables: these are variables that are within the scope of a program / function / procedure.
	- Global Variables: these are variables that are in the scope for the time the program's execution. They can be retrieved by any part of the program.

Basic program structures are:
	- IF..THEN : allows the computer to make a decision based on the result of an expression. When an IF..THEN structure is encountered, it evaluates the provided expression. If the expression is false, the computer moves on to the next structure, ignoring the contents of the IF..THEN block. If the expression is true, the computer executes the associated action before moving on to the next instruction in the program.
	- FOR Loops : used to execute a specific set of instructions a specific number of times, based on an expression. A variable acts as a counter inside a range of values identified by a minimum and a maximum. Every time the loop is executed, the counter variable is incremented. When the counter is equal to the defined maximum value, the loop is abandoned and the execution moves on to the next instruction.
	- WHILE Loops : used to execute a specific set of instruction while an expression is true. Often the instructions inside the loop will eventually make the expression evaluate as false.

PROTOTYPING
	is the process of creating a rudimentary working model of a product or system. Used for performance evaluation and further improvement of product. May be relatively expensive to produce. It is an actual, working version of the product.
	In the IoT, it is often used as a technology demonstrator.

Characteristics that indicate an organization may be dealing with Big Data:
	- They have a large number of data that increasingly requires more storage space (volume).
	- They have an amount of data that is growing exponentially fast (velocity).
	- They have data that is generated in different formats (variety).

Major data storage problems:
	- Management (data can be generated and collected from multiple different sources so a management system must be used to organize and collate all the sources. there are few data sharing standards and thousands of data management tools available)
	- Security (data must be kept secure and only accessible by authorized users)
	- Redundancy (safeguards should be in place to maintain the integrity of the stored data; processes for backups, redundancy, and disaster recovery are required)
	- Analytics (big data contains both structured and unstructured data; unstructured data such as emails or photos are difficult to analyze and consume a lot of storage space; structured data such as a spreadsheet is easier to analyze and store; data storage systems must be able to manage both types)
	- Access (big data must be accessible from anywhere at anytime)

Fog Computing
	is an architecture that utilizes end-user clients or 'edge' devices to do a substantial amount of the preprocessing and storage required by an organization.
	was designed to keep the data closer to the source for preprocessing.
	After the data has been preprocessed, it is often shipped off for longer term storage, backup, or deeper analysis within the cloud.

The Cloud and Cloud Computing
	The cloud is a collection of data centers or groups of connected servers. Access to software, storage, and services available on the servers is obtained through the Internet via a browser interface.

	From an individual's perspective, using cloud services allows:
		- to store all of data, such as pictures, music, movies, and emails, freeing up local hard drive space.
		- to access many applications instead of downloading them onto local device.
		- to access data and applications anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

	One of the disadvantages of using the cloud is that data could fall into the wrong hands. The data is at the mercy of the security robustness of the chosen cloud provider.
